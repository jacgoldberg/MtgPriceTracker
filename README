How to use:
    Name of the Card and the Set that the card is from are required in order to add a card

    Once you have add all of the cards you want to track you can hit "Update Spreadsheet" this will attach a link as well as price track to the cards.
        - The reason the add card and update spread sheet method are separated is due to slow performance with the update method
    
    In order to add the current value of your card on ownership, that must be manually submitted in the spread sheet
        - open up the spread sheet
        - change the initial cost
        - save and quit
        - update spread sheet

    - Set Name: "March of the Machine" | Card Name: "Faerie Mastermind" | Link: https://www.mtggoldfish.com/price/March+of+the+Machine/Faerie+Mastermind#paper
